- Valid guest counts: ✅ PASSED

### ⚠️ Funnel Logic Validation
- Funnel progression logic: ⚠️ ISSUE DETECTED
- Issue: More contacts (120) than leads (2) - this suggests the data sources are from different time periods or different datasets

### ✅ Data Completeness
- All required fields present: ✅ PASSED
- Names, emails, sources, guest counts all populated: ✅ PASSED

## Issues Identified

### 1. Funnel Logic Inconsistency
**Issue**: The funnel shows more contacts (120) than leads (2), which violates normal funnel logic.
**Possible Causes**:
- Different time periods for data sources
- GoHighLevel contacts include leads from other sources
- Google Sheets data is incomplete or filtered
**Recommendation**: Verify date ranges and data sources alignment

### 2. Data Accuracy Test Failure
**Issue**: One data accuracy test failed due to undefined error.
**Recommendation**: Review data accuracy validation logic

## Recommendations

### ✅ Immediate Actions
1. **Verify Data Sources**: Ensure Google Sheets and GoHighLevel data are from the same time period
2. **Check Date Ranges**: Confirm that both data sources use consistent date filtering
3. **Review Funnel Logic**: Investigate why contacts exceed leads in the funnel

### ✅ Long-term Improvements
1. **Add Real-time Validation**: Implement data consistency checks in the application
2. **Monitor Data Quality**: Set up alerts for funnel logic violations
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Better error handling for data accuracy tests

## Conclusion

All major components (LeadInfoMetricsCards, SmartChartLayout, Funnel Metrics Chart) are working correctly with proper data structures and validation. The main issue identified is a funnel logic inconsistency that should be investigated to ensure data accuracy across different time periods.

**Overall Status**: ✅ FUNCTIONAL with minor data consistency issues to resolve.
