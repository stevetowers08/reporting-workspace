## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. MCP servers provide specific capabilities that AI assistants can use to perform tasks beyond their built-in functionality.

## Playwright MCP Server

### What is Playwright MCP?

The Playwright MCP server enables AI assistants in Cursor to:
- Navigate web pages
- Take screenshots
- Interact with web elements (click, type, etc.)
- Execute JavaScript in browsers
- Scrape web content
- Generate test code
- And much more!

## Prerequisites

- Cursor IDE installed
- Node.js installed (for npx command)
- Internet connection (for downloading the MCP server)

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install the Playwright MCP Server Package

Install the official Playwright MCP server package globally or locally:

```bash
# Global installation (recommended)
npm install -g @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server

# Or local installation in your project
npm install @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

### Step 2: Configure Cursor MCP Settings

You need to add the MCP server configuration to Cursor. There are two ways to do this:

#### Method A: Workspace Configuration (Recommended)

Create or edit `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Method B: Global Configuration

Add the configuration to Cursor's global MCP settings:

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline\settings\mcp_settings.json`

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`

**Linux**: `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Restart Cursor

Close and reopen Cursor IDE to load the new MCP configuration.

## Verification

To verify the setup is working:

1. **Check MCP Status**: Look for MCP server status in Cursor's status bar
2. **Test Commands**: Try asking Cursor to perform browser automation tasks like:
   - "Take a screenshot of google.com"
   - "Navigate to my website and click the login button"
   - "Extract all the text content from this page"

## Available Tools

Once configured, you'll have access to these Playwright tools:

### Navigation
- Navigate to URLs
- Go back/forward in browser history
- Refresh pages

### Screenshots
- Take viewport screenshots
- Capture full page screenshots
- Screenshot specific elements

### Element Interaction
- Click elements by CSS selector
- Type text into form fields
- Select dropdown options
- Hover over elements
- Drag and drop elements

### Content Extraction
- Get page HTML content
- Extract text from specific elements
- Get element attributes
- Extract links and images

### JavaScript Execution
- Execute custom JavaScript in page context
- Evaluate expressions
- Interact with page APIs

### Advanced Features
- Handle multiple tabs/windows
- Manage cookies and local storage
- Handle file uploads
- Generate test code
- Web scraping capabilities

## Usage Examples

Here are some example commands you can use with Cursor:

### Basic Navigation
```
"Navigate to https://example.com"
"Take a screenshot of the current page"
"Go back to the previous page"
```

### Form Interaction
```
"Fill out the contact form with test data"
"Click the submit button"
"Type 'test@example.com' into the email field"
```

### Content Extraction
```
"Extract all the text content from this page"
"Get all the links on this page"
"Find all images and their alt text"
```

### Testing and Automation
```
"Generate a Playwright test for this page"
"Test the login flow on this website"
"Check if all buttons are clickable"
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Appearing

1. **Check Configuration**: Verify the MCP configuration is correct
2. **Restart Cursor**: Close and reopen Cursor completely
3. **Check Logs**: Look at Cursor's MCP logs for errors
4. **Verify Installation**: Ensure the package is installed: `npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server --version`

### Common Issues

**Permission Errors**: Run Cursor as administrator if needed

**Network Issues**: Ensure you have internet access for the initial download

**Node.js Issues**: Make sure Node.js and npm are installed and accessible

### MCP Logs Location

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\logs\[timestamp]\window[number]\exthost\anysphere.cursor-mcp\`

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/logs/[timestamp]/window[number]/exthost/anysphere.cursor-mcp/`

**Linux**: `~/.config/Cursor/logs/[timestamp]/window[number]/exthost/anysphere.cursor-mcp/`

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Browser Options

You can customize browser behavior by modifying the MCP server arguments:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server", "--headless=false"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Multiple MCP Servers

You can run multiple MCP servers simultaneously:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/directory"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Headless Mode**: The browser runs in headless mode by default for security
- **Local Execution**: All browser automation happens locally on your machine
- **No Data Collection**: The MCP server doesn't collect or transmit your data
- **Sandboxed**: Browser instances are sandboxed and isolated

## Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Selectors**: Be specific with CSS selectors for reliable element interaction
2. **Handle Errors**: Always include error handling in your automation requests
3. **Test First**: Test automation on non-production websites first
4. **Monitor Performance**: Be aware of resource usage during automation
5. **Clean Up**: The MCP server automatically cleans up browser instances

## Additional MCP Servers

### Adding More MCP Servers

You can run multiple MCP servers simultaneously by adding them to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/directory"]
    },
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-supabase"]
    }
  }
}
```
