## üîÑ IN PROGRESS TASKS

### 1. Google Ads Demographics & Campaign Breakdown
- **Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- **Issue:** Demographics and campaign breakdown showing 0% despite API calls
- **Root Cause:** Google Ads API returning 400 errors for demographics queries
- **Evidence:** 
  - Console shows 400 errors for `gender_view` and `age_range_view` queries
  - API calls are correctly formatted but account may not have demographics data
  - Main metrics working perfectly (10 leads, $391 spend, etc.)
- **Next Steps:** 
  - Investigate exact API error messages
  - Check if account has Performance Max/Search campaigns with demographics
  - Consider alternative data sources or account configuration

## üìù NOTES

### Architecture Decisions Made:
- **Direct replacement** over feature flags (cleaner migration)
- **Promise.allSettled** for parallel API calls (needs bug fix)
- **Smart caching** with dependency-based invalidation
- **Request deduplication** to prevent duplicate calls
- **Platform adapter pattern** for unified data handling

### Technical Debt:
- Debug logging still present in some files (needs cleanup)
- Some hardcoded values remain (low priority)
- Error messages could be more user-friendly (low priority)

### Dependencies:
- Supabase MCP access working correctly
- Facebook Graph API v18.0 integration stable
- Google Ads API v21 integration working for main metrics
- React Query configuration optimized
- Vite build system working properly
